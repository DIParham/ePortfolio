## Professional Self Assessment
### Educational Reflection:
My Computer Science journey officially began in the September of 2018. Since then, I have acquired an assortment of skills and understanding of concepts that would support me in this field. 

Through the completion of my coursework throughout the program and the development of this ePortfolio, I was able to enhance my knowledge of best practices and skills. First and foremost, I want to place an emphasis on precision and consistency. These are crucial to programming. There have been many instances in which my programs failed to run due to mistakes in the code. At the same time, enhancing these skills accentuated the importance and necessity of peer reviews. In the CS 310: Collaboration and Team Project course, we were exposed to the benefits of peer reviews and code reviews in general. It would provide opportunities to catch mistakes and inconsistencies that we originally missed. This course also introduced us to the advantages of team collaboration. We were assigned to create a Jukebox Java application in which each student was required to write a small portion of the code and push it into a repository. There were a couple instances where the code failed to compile or presented a bug. This provided occasions for students to work together to resolve the issue. 

Communication with stakeholders is another crucial skill to have and one that I learned in the CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle. It emphasized on the importance and necessity of communicating with stakeholders and understanding what they want in a project as well as highlighted essential software development practices. With the comprehension of this skill, it correlates with the CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance course. In this course, we designed and built a CRUD java module for a Task Service program. The stakeholders for this project communicated that the program should prevent the use of Null or invalid input that exceeded a character limit. This project utilized JUnit testing to ensure that the program functions as anticipated. Understanding this perspective of software development, provides me with a better understanding of how to find flaws in a program to ensure its desired functionality. 

In CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms, we learned about the necessity of data structures and algorithms in programming. Through this course, I am able to comprehend the purpose and functionality of data structures and algorithms. It enables data to be stored and used efficiently. In this course, we ventured into the concepts and functionality of the Binary Search Tree. We used this data structure to sort through bid items. The CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course depicted how to utilize MongoDB, MySQL, and Python to create an interactive dashboard. It showcased how the combined usage of various programming concepts and tools could be used to create informative programs. Security was another topic that was addressed in the Computer Science program. The course, CS 405: Secure Coding, educated us about the gaps and vulnerabilities that could be present in a program and how to recognize them. This is an essential skill to have as it ensures the security of a program as well as allows us to understand the implications of a vulnerability. 

### Portfolio Summary:
For my ePortfolio, I wanted to utilize projects that showcase the skills and concepts I learned throughout this course. Various courses such as CS 250, CS 320, CS 260, CS 340, and CS 405, have enhanced my understanding of software engineering techniques, concepts, and practices. CS 250 dove into the Software Development Lifecycle topic and enhanced my knowledge of how teams and stakeholders work together to develop a project. CS 320 demonstrated the practices used to ensure that the project meets specifications and required functionality. CS 260 expanded my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, allowing me to store and use data efficiently. In CS 340, I was able to combine the usage of databases and programming to create interactive dashboards. CS 405 highlighted on the importance of secure coding and the ability to recognize vulnerabilities and gaps in the code. 

These projects do not correlate with each other, however, they each portray my abilities and understanding of computer science concepts and practices. Through these enhancements, I am able to demonstrate what I have learned from this program. 

#### Enhancement One:
For this reasoning, I based my first enhancement project on the CS 320 Task Service project. In this enhancement, the project is rewritten in another programming language. This demonstrates my ability and knowledge of both Java and Python. I chose to use this project for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates the concepts learned from these classes. It utilizes white-box testing, secure coding, and incorporates software development lifecycle concepts. 

With this project, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by maintaining and incorporating well-commented code to enhance understanding and influence improvement. 

I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by utilizing white-box testing techniques to ensure the program’s expected functionality when invalid input is used. 

I demonstrated the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by incorporating the unittest python module to conduct white-box testing. This ensured that the enhanced project functioned as required and expected. 

#### Enhancement Two:
I built the second artifact off of the CS 260 Binary Search Tree project. This project uses a binary search tree data structure to effectively sort, remove, add, and insert data. With this enhancement I demonstrated my understanding of the binary search tree data structure as well as of the C++ programming language. Aside from this, I used the knowledge gained from CS 405: Secure Coding, to recognize, locate, and fix memory deallocation errors that were present in the code. The incorporation of this artifact in my ePortfolio effectively highlights my capabilities with data structures and secure coding.

I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by incorporating a second binary search tree to improve the efficiency of the program. This allowed users to navigate the bids easily and more efficiently. 

I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by recognizing, locating, and resolving memory leak errors in the code. Through this I was able to properly deallocate the memory and showcase a security mindset capable of anticipating design flaws and potential vulnerabilities in software. 

#### Enhancement Three:
The third artifact is based off of the data from DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining. With the data from DAT 220 and the knowledge gained from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts, I was able to create an interactive dashboard that filtered through restaurant information. I designed this project to enable users to add and save data to MongoDB from the dashboard. I also incorporated an interactive graph that would better illustrate patterns in the data. This showcases my comprehension of MongoDB, Python, SQL, databases, and data mining concepts.  

With this project, I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by incorporating a scatter plot that displayed data patterns. Aside from the CRUD abilities incorporated into the dashboard, I designed a graph that would change according to a dropdown selection. This would effectively communicate to the audience patterns in the data.

I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by thoroughly commenting throughout the project. Descriptive comments would provide understanding of the project’s purpose and functionality and grant opportunities for further improvement.
